Jenkins installation steps:

Reference link: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu

Ubuntu:
Pre-requisite:
-Java
=============================
1. Installation of Java:

Jenkins requires Java in order to run, yet certain distributions don’t include this by default and some Java versions are incompatible with Jenkins.

There are multiple Java implementations which you can use. OpenJDK is the most popular one at the moment, we will use it in this guide.

Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 11, and check the installation with the commands:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.12+7-post-Debian-2)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.12+7-post-Debian-2, mixed mode, sharing)

===========================================================
2. Installation of jenkins:

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins

==============================================================
Troubleshooting:

The package installation will:

Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. Run systemctl cat jenkins for more details.

Create a ‘jenkins’ user to run this service.

Direct console log output to systemd-journald. Run journalctl -u jenkins.service if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.

Populate /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g JENKINS_HOME

Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

If Jenkins fails to start because a port is in use, run systemctl edit jenkins and add the following:

[Service]
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8081"
Here, "8081" was chosen but you can put another port available.
==================================================================================

In ubuntu, we need to configure below steps for the newly created user in the slave machine:
****** Be as root user to perform below steps*****
 sudo useradd -m <username>
 usermod -aG sudo <username> // to add a user to the group
 chsh -s /bin/bash <username> //to give a full bash permission to the user
 -logout as root
 -exit
 -sudo su - <username>

==================================================
