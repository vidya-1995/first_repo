To create and Switch User in UBUNTU:

if you create new User in ubuntu, by defoult /Home directory is not created and if you try to switch to new User only "$" symbol is shown without /Home directory,
so we need to configure for /Home directory by below 2 metohods: 

In ubuntu, we need to configure below steps for the newly created user in the slave machine:
****** Be as root user to perform below steps*****
 sudo useradd -m <username>
 usermod -aG sudo <username> // to add a user to the group
 chsh -s /bin/bash <username> //to give a full bash permission to the user
 -logout as root
 -exit
 -sudo su - <username>

********** OR ***************** 
use it with the single command
 
sudo useradd -m -s $(which bash) -G sudo <USERNAME>
Eg: sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo devops
